Project Outcome, Impact, and Future Considerations
====================================================

Project goal
------------
Identify market “white space” opportunities for health insurance companies by analyzing ACA Marketplace plan attributes and visualizing geographic concentration, plan-type dominance, and metal-level distribution.

What this project solved
------------------------
Insurance markets are crowded and competitive. This dashboard helps decision-makers quickly:
- spot states with high vs low plan concentration,
- understand which plan types dominate,
- compare product mix by metal level and new vs existing plans.

Key results (from the dashboard story)
--------------------------------------
- Strong geographic concentration: Texas is the highest-count state (4,660) while Alaska is low (64), highlighting saturation vs under-penetration.
- Product dominance: HMO is the most common plan type (~50% share in the treemap).
- Retention vs acquisition: existing enrollments dominate (~75% of total), with HMO + Gold appearing as a key backbone plan category.

Business impact (how an insurer could use it)
---------------------------------------------
- Market entry strategy: prioritize 2–3 lower-saturation states for expansion where plan variety is limited.
- Product strategy: design differentiated options (e.g., PPO flexibility or HSA-eligible plans) in underserved locations rather than competing head-to-head in saturated markets.
- Targeted marketing: tailor outreach by regional plan-type preferences (e.g., PPO-leaning vs HMO-leaning regions).

Future considerations
---------------------
- Add time-series analysis across plan years to track shifts in plan types and metal levels.
- Include pricing/benefit variables (premium, deductible, OOP max) to quantify affordability “gaps”.
- Build a scoring model to rank states by opportunity (low saturation + low plan variety + target metal levels).
